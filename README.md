 A button that once clicked creates a phone verification popup with the option to enter 6 digits in different inputs as an OTP. The popup should have the following conditions:
 
 
 
The user can enter only a 6 digit (numeric) OTP (No alphabets, spaces, or other characters should be allowed)

Once a digit is entered, the focus should move to the next input
Backspace should delete the input and focus on the previous input
The user can navigate the input boxes with arrow keys
If the user pastes the OTP from the clipboard, it should auto-fill the input boxes
